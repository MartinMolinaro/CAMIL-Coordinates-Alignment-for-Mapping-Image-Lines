# CAMIL-Coordinates-Alignment-for-Mapping-Image-Lines
CAMIL (Coordinates Alignment for Mapping Image Lines) is an algorithm that extract the 2D coordinates of open curves and lines extracted from an image. This algorithm overtakes current pixel ordering/interpolation methods do not perform well if there are free (that do not have a particular horizontal or vertical orientation) curves in the images.
